# SzakatsA.ASPUtilities.HealthCheckExtensions

A small extension for ASP.NET Core that maps a `/healthz` endpoint and returns detailed health check results in a clean JSON format.

This package simplifies exposing application health diagnostics in a structured and readable way, making it easier to integrate with monitoring tools or health dashboards.

---

## Features

- Adds a JSON health check endpoint with minimal setup
- Outputs overall status, total duration, and individual check details
- Custom DTOs to simplify and structure the output
- Supports tags, metadata, error messages, and execution duration

---

## Installation

Add a reference to the project or install via NuGet (if published):

    dotnet add package HealthChecks.JsonResponse

## Usage

In your Program.cs or Startup.cs file:

    using HealthChecks.JsonResponse;
    
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    
    // Register health checks service
    builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck<ExampleHealthCheck>("example_check");
    
    var app = builder.Build();
    
    // Map the JSON health check endpoint
    app.MapHealthChecksJSON("/healthz");
    
    app.Run();
